I was at the Edward Jenner institute in Oxford, standing behind a scientist as she looked at some magnified blood samples.

There were two sets of slides ‚Äî one from subjects who had been given the vaccine prototype, and one from a control group. The slides from the control group were more or less blank, whereas the slides from the vaccinated group were full of dots ‚Äî lots of dots. The dots were antibodies. I could tell from the excitement of the scientists that this was promising and that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine looked as though it would work.

After exhaustive tests, so it has proved. That vaccine is safe and works extremely well, and now, only six months later, it is being made in multiple places from India to the US, as well as Britain, and it is being used around the world.

It is relatively easy to distribute, since it can be kept in an ordinary fridge, and under the terms of the deal struck between Oxford and the UK government it is being dispensed at cost. You may wonder why we have done it that way, or why the taxpayer has already spent hundreds of millions of pounds, through Covax and other schemes, to put jabs in the arms of other populations.

The answer is blindingly obvious ‚Äî the principle of enlightened self-interest that underlies the integrated review of UK security, defence, development and foreign policy that is published today.

Successful as the UK vaccination programme may be, there is little point in achieving some isolated national immunity. We need the whole world to be protected. We need the whole world to have the confidence to open up for trade and travel and holidays and business, all the things that drive jobs and improve our lives at home.

The objective of Global Britain is not to swagger or strike attitudes on the world stage. It is to use the full spectrum of our abilities, now amplified by record spending on both defence and science, to engage with and help the rest of the world. That is how we serve the British interest, and I mean the economic interest of people up and down the country. And as the vaccine programme begins to inspire a new global hope, we want to use this moment to heal, both literally and figuratively.

The UK is using its G7 presidency to foster ideas for a new world treaty on pandemic preparedness so that next time humanity avoids the sauve qui peut squabbling that has disfigured the last 12 months. There is work to be done on the sharing of data, on the tracking of zoonotic diseases, on quarantine protocols and how to marshal drugs and personal protective equipment.

It is obvious from our experience that this would be good for Britain as much as the rest of the world. As we prepare to build back better, we are working with the World Trade Organisation and its new director-general, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, not only to revive world trade but to address the stagnation that pre-dated the pandemic.

At the Cop26 summit in Glasgow the UK is leading the world in the campaign to reduce CO2 emissions and arrest the overheating of the planet. Britain was the first major western country to commit to the goal of net zero by 2050 and it is wonderful ‚Äî and moving ‚Äî to see how other countries are now pledging themselves to the same goal.

Those pledges will be hollow, however, without serious commitments, mainly to the use of new technology, that will make those reductions happen. Again, we in the UK are taking those big and bold steps, not only because it is good for the world but because these green technologies, from wind to hydrogen to carbon capture, have the potential to create hundreds of thousands of high-wage, high-skill jobs in Britain.

It is thanks to our history and geography that the UK is already in many ways more global than our comparators. We have a vast diaspora of people, perhaps five or six million, living abroad, far more as a proportion than most others in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We may have only 1 per cent of the world‚Äôs population, but we are the fifth biggest exporter of goods and services.

And we have a third invisible diaspora, far more important and more fruitful even than people or goods, and that is the vast dispersal of British ideas, and British values, puffed around the world like the seeds of some giant pollinating tree. I mean everything from habeas corpus and parliamentary democracy to freedom of speech and gender equality. Sometimes these ideas have flourished, and put forth great roots and branches. Sometimes, frankly, they still fall on stony ground.

So under this integrated review we will work ever harder, and give ourselves all the tools we need, to co-ordinate with like-minded democracies in the US, in Europe and around the world to protect and advance those ideas and beliefs against those who oppose them.

We must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work better to protect and defend them.

Here are the headline points:

Simpler bus fares with daily price caps, so people can use the bus as many times a day as they need without facing mounting costs.

We want bus services to be easier to use and understand. All the info passengers need to plan their journey should be at their fingertips, easily accessible online. üì±

Bus services should be better integrated with other types of local transport, with passengers able to use the same ticket for their whole journey. üöÑüöç

84% of buses across England already accept contactless payment, but we want to see that rise to 100% so that buses are easy to use for everyone, everywhere. üí≥

Disabled people must be able to use bus services as easily as other passengers. Next stop announcements will help everyone travel with confidence. ‚ôøü¶Æüßè‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We‚Äôre announcing the recipients of our ¬£20 million fund which enables on-demand services ‚Äìsuch as mini buses booked via an app‚Äì to be trialled in areas where traditional bus services aren‚Äôt appropriate.

As we accelerate the transition to greener, more sustainable transport, we‚Äôre delivering 4,000 new zero-emission buses and are today launching a consultation on ending the sale of new diesel buses. üöçüå≥

And once again I pay tribute to the astonishing efforts of everyone involved ‚Äì the GPs, the nurses, the volunteers, the army and the pharmacists like Hardik Desai - who rallied local volunteers to vaccinate 3,000 people in his village hall in Ticehurst in Sussex, while keeping his pharmacy open - and of course I thank all of you who have come forward to be vaccinated.

This is an unprecedented national achievement but it‚Äôs no moment to relax and in fact it‚Äôs the moment to accelerate because the threat from this virus remains very real.
Yes, it‚Äôs true, we have vaccinated more than 90 per cent of those aged over 70 but don‚Äôt forget that 60 per cent of hospital patients with COVID are under 70.

And although the vaccination programme is going well, we still don‚Äôt have enough data about the exact effectiveness of the vaccines in reducing the spread of infection.

We have some interesting straws in the wind. We have grounds for confidence. But the vaccinations have only been running for a matter of weeks - and while we are learning the whole time - we don‚Äôt today have all the hard facts that we need.

And the level of infection remains very high, with more people still in hospital today than at the peak last April and admissions running at 1,600 a day.

So we have to keep our foot to the floor. And I can tell you today that the next million letters are landing on people‚Äôs mats right now, offering appointments to the over-65s and we are also contacting all those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers.

And if we can keep this pace up ‚Äì and if we can keep supply steady ‚Äì and I hope and believe we can - then we hope to offer a vaccination to everyone in the first nine priority groups ‚Äì including everyone over 50 ‚Äì by the end of April.

And at the same time we will be giving second doses to millions of the most vulnerable within twelve weeks of the first.

So this moment is a huge step forward but it‚Äôs only a first step.
And while it shows what the country can do we must be both optimistic but also patient.

And next week I will be setting out a roadmap saying as much as we possibly can about the route to normality even though some things are very uncertain.

Because we want this lockdown to be the last. And we want progress to be cautious but also irreversible. 

So please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.

Thank you.",-,-,-,,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,5358,2148,24652,1101,24652,21090,2978,131.0,232.0,179.0,22.0,20.0

Two hundred years ago Cornwall‚Äôs tin and copper mines were at the heart of the UK‚Äôs industrial revolution. This summer Cornwall will again be the nucleus of great global change and advancement.

As we revive the global economy after coronavirus, we want to help the world to build back better and greener.

Both of these ambitions are summed up in Cornwall, where the UK‚Äôs renewable energy industry points the way to a green industrial future, and where Newquay spaceport and Goonhilly Earth Station showcase the best of British technology.

I‚Äôm very much looking forward to welcoming world leaders to this great region and country.

I hope and believe that this agreement will also serve to end some of the rancour and recrimination that we‚Äôve had in recent years, allow us to come to together as a country, to leave old arguments, old desiccated super masticated arguments behind, move on and build a new and great future for our country.

Because those of us who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU never sought a rupture with our closest neighbours.

We never wanted to sever ourselves from fellow democracies beneath whose soil lie British war graves in tranquil cemeteries, often tended by local schoolchildren, testament to our shared struggle for freedom and everything we cherish in common.

What we wanted was not a rupture but a resolution, a resolution of the old, tired, vexed question of Britain‚Äôs political relations with Europe, which has bedevilled our post-War history. First, we stood aloof, then we became a half-hearted, sometimes obstructive member of the EU.

Now, with this deal, we are going to become a friendly neighbour ‚Äì the best friend and ally the EU could have ‚Äì working hand-in-glove whenever our values and interests coincide while fulfilling the sovereign wish of the British people to live under their own laws, made by their own elected Parliament.",-,-,-,,-,-,Photo,-,https://www.facebook.com/borisjohnson/photos/a.238842266316/10158048175416317/,-,-,6299,2770,29899,2234,29899,25550,3646,170.0,325.0,144.0,35.0,29.0
